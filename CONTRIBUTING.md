# Contributor Guidelines

## Overview
Welcome to the Digital Double Virtual Workforce project! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the project, including workflows, naming conventions, and integration protocols.

## Workflows
1. **Branching Strategy**: 
   - Use Git worktrees or dedicated feature branches for isolating features and fixes.
   - Ensure that branches are named descriptively, e.g., `feature/add-new-module`.

2. **Commit Messages**: 
   - Commit changes in small, atomic increments.
   - Use clear and descriptive messages that tie directly to project objectives.

3. **Tagging Milestones**: 
   - Tag major milestones to track significant progress points.

## Naming Conventions
- Use a structured naming convention for files and submodules to improve clarity and scalability.
- Example: `core/[module]/[submodule].ext`

## Integration Protocols
- Ensure that all code is tested before merging into the main branch.
- Conduct periodic scope reviews to align incremental progress with project goals.

## Documentation
- Use `document.md` as the central hub for updates, documenting key decisions, changes, and progress.
- Update this `CONTRIBUTING.md` file as necessary to reflect any changes in guidelines.

## Contact
For any questions or clarifications, please reach out to the project maintainers.
