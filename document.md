### Git Workflow
1. Feature branches: feature/description
2. Fix branches: fix/description
3. Release branches: release/v{major}.{minor}
4. Commit format: type(scope): description

### Git Commit Guidelines

Commits must follow the Conventional Commits specification with additional rules:

- Format: `type(scope): Subject`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Scope is optional but must be lowercase
- Subject must:
  - Start with a capital letter
  - Be between 10-72 characters
  - Use imperative mood

Examples:
```
feat(auth): Add user authentication
fix(api): Resolve connection timeout
docs: Update installation guide
```

### Development Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement with tests
3. Document changes
4. Submit PR with checklist
5. Peer review
6. Merge to development

## Version Control Workflow

### Branch Management
