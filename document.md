# Digital Double Virtual Workforce 3.5 - Core Documentation

---

## Overview

A fully autonomous, adaptive, multi-agent AI platform with immersive visualization, real-time research, internal IDE, plugin integration, self-healing, and edge-ready deployment.

---

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

- Specialized agents (planner, researcher, coder, messenger, execution, creative, file).
- Autonomous task generation, prioritization, and scheduling.
- Multi-step reasoning with chained prompts.
- Dynamic task decomposition and coordination.
- Role-based collaboration for complex workflows.

---

## Plugin Integration

- Event-driven plugin adapters for:
  - Docker
  - Git
  - CI/CD
  - External APIs
  - System Control
  - Zapier (planned)
- Redis pub/sub communication.
- Async APIs with secure, auditable execution.
- Extensible for new tools and services.

### Plugin Integration Framework Architecture

All plugin adapters (Docker, Git, CI/CD, API, etc.) implement a common `IPluginAdapter` interface to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

**Key Interface Methods:**
- `initialize()`: Prepare the adapter (auth, client setup).
- `healthCheck()`: Verify operational status.
- `shutdown()`: Cleanup resources.
- Optional: `getStatus()`: Fetch plugin-specific status.

**Adapter Implementation Guidelines:**
- Implement all `IPluginAdapter` methods.
- Use async/await with robust error handling.
- Log errors and key events with context.
- Avoid blocking calls; prefer async APIs.
- Support configuration via constructor or environment.

**Adding a New Plugin Adapter:**
1. Create a new class in `src/modules/plugin_integration/` implementing `IPluginAdapter`.
2. Implement lifecycle methods and plugin-specific commands.
3. Add unit tests in `tests/modules/`.
4. Document usage and API in this file.
5. Commit changes with descriptive messages.

**Contributor Workflow for Plugin Integration:**
- Use feature branches or worktrees for new adapters.
- Write atomic commits tied to specific objectives.
- Update this documentation with every major change.
- Tag milestones (e.g., `plugin-integration-v1`).
- Run all tests and static analysis before merge.

## Adaptive Learning & Research

- Real-time web scraping and knowledge base updates.
- Adaptive prompt refinement and self-reprogramming.
- Scientific reasoning and synthesis path prediction.
- Personalized recommendations based on user data.

---

## Internal IDE & Code Automation

- Autonomous code writing, execution, and validation.
- Contextual code generation and debugging.

---

## Memory & Knowledge Base

- Dynamic memory for task continuity.
- Conversation history and metadata management.
- Persistent vector database integration (planned).
- Continuous knowledge base updates.

---

## Self-Healing & Predictive Analytics

- **SelfHealingManager:** Detects anomalies, triggers corrective routines.
- **MLService:** Predicts faults before they occur.
- Closed-loop resilience for continuous improvement.

---

## Testing & CI/CD

- Unit tests for agents, plugins, self-healing, ML.
- Integration tests for full workflows.
- Automated testing pipelines.
- Continuous validation of autonomous behaviors.
- Documentation sync with code changes.
