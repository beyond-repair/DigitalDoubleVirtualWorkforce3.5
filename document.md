### Development Workflow
1. Document changes in document.md
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement tests (90% coverage)
4. Write code following standards
5. Update documentation
6. Submit PR with changelog

### Current Module Status
- [x] Project Structure: Reorganized
- [ ] ML Services: Implementing quantization
- [ ] Testing: Setting up framework
- [ ] CI/CD: Configuration pending
- [x] Notification Service: Initial implementation with tests
  - Integrated Socket.IO for real-time event emission.
  - Added user preference management (realtime toggle, disabled types).

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Build modular notification system** (Current Focus)
   - Real-time updates
   - User preferences management
   - Integration with existing services
2. Implement model quantization system
   - Hardware-aware scaling
   - Automatic fallback mechanisms
   - Performance monitoring
3. Set up testing framework
   - Unit tests for ML services
   - Integration tests for agent system
   - Performance benchmarks
4. Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Automated testing
   - Code quality checks
   - Documentation updates
