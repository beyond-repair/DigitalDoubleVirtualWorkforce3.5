# UI Migration, API Integration, and Feature Enhancement Documentation

## Overview

This document details the migration of legacy UI components, integration of APIs, and feature enhancements performed within the new React-based UI structure (`ui-react/`).

---

## 1. Migrated Components

### Existing React Components Integrated
- **AgentDashboard**: Displays agent information, fetches data from API.
- **TaskManager**: Provides task submission UI.
- **MetricsChart**: Visualizes system metrics.
- **AgentCard**: Displays individual agent details (used within AgentDashboard).

### Legacy Visualization Logic
- **AgentVisualizerBridge** (legacy TypeScript class) was wrapped into a new React component:
- **`AgentVisualizer.tsx`**: React component that initializes the visualization, now updated to use real-time backend data.

---

## 2. Integration Details

- **`ui-react/src/App.tsx`** was modified to embed:
  - `<AgentDashboard />`
  - `<TaskManager />`
  - `<MetricsChart />`
- Created **`ui-react/src/AgentVisualizer.tsx`** to encapsulate the visualization logic.
- Fixed import paths to legacy TypeScript files (`src/ui/building/`).

---

## 3. Enhancements Made

- Migrated UI components into a unified React app.
- Wrapped legacy visualization logic in a React component.
- **Replaced simulation with real-time Socket.IO event handling.**
- Modularized UI for easier future enhancements.

---

## 4. Next Steps / TODOs

- Connect `TaskManager` to actual task submission endpoints.
- Display ML predictions and analytics from `MLService`.
- Add notification and user preference features.
- Improve UI/UX styling with Material-UI or similar.
- Implement error handling and loading states.
- Write tests for new components and integrations.

## 5. File Summary

| File | Purpose |
|-------|----------|
| `ui-react/src/App.tsx` | Main React app entry, embeds all components |
| `ui-react/src/AgentVisualizer.tsx` | React wrapper for visualization, now with real-time data |
| `src/ui/components/` | Existing React components (migrated) |
| `src/ui/building/` | Legacy visualization logic (wrapped) |

---

## 6. Notes

- The visualization **now uses live backend events** via Socket.IO.
- API URLs and keys in `AgentDashboard` are placeholders.
- Further backend integration is required for full functionality.

---

## 7. Real-Time Event Integration (April 6, 2025)

- Installed `socket.io-client` in `ui-react`.
- Initialized Socket.IO client in `AgentVisualizer.tsx`.
- Subscribed to backend events:
  - `agentCreated`
  - `statusChanged`
  - `taskAssigned`
  - `taskCompleted`
- Updated `AgentVisualState` and triggered re-renders on events.
- **Removed the previous simulation loop**; visualization now reflects live data.
