# Module: lead_ai

This module focuses on machine learning capabilities, specifically related to lead generation or management AI functionalities. Currently, it contains the core ML service logic.

## File: `ml_service.py`

### Purpose

This file defines the `MLService` class, which encapsulates the machine learning logic for the `lead_ai` module. It appears designed to handle model training, tracking, and prediction tasks, specifically workload prediction.

### Imports

-   **`from typing import Dict, List, Optional`**: Imports type hinting classes (`Dict`, `List`, `Optional`) for defining function signatures and variable types, improving code readability and maintainability.
-   **`from datetime import datetime`**: Imports the `datetime` class for working with dates and times, likely used for timestamping data or predictions.
-   **`from ..monitoring.logger import Logger`**: Imports the `Logger` class from a relative path (`../monitoring`), suggesting integration with a centralized logging system within the project. (Note: This import is present but `Logger` is not used in the provided snippet).
-   **`from .model_tracker import ModelTracker`**: Imports the `ModelTracker` class from the same directory (`.`), indicating a dependency on a local helper class responsible for tracking ML model versions or performance.

### Class: `MLService`

#### Purpose

Manages machine learning models, training data, and prediction processes within the `lead_ai` context. It interacts with an analytics service and uses a model tracker.

#### Attributes

-   **`training_data: Dict`** (Line 9): Initialized as an empty dictionary. Likely intended to store data used for training ML models.
-   **`MIN_TRAINING_POINTS: int`** (Line 10): A constant set to `1000`. Represents the minimum number of data points required before a model training process can be initiated.
-   **`model_tracker: ModelTracker`** (Line 11): An instance of the `ModelTracker` class, initialized with the `analytics_service`. Used to manage and track different versions or performance metrics of the ML models used by this service.
-   **`current_model_version: str`** (Line 12): Initialized to `"1.0.0"`. Stores the version identifier of the currently active machine learning model.

#### Methods

##### `__init__(self, analytics_service)`

-   **Purpose**: Constructor for the `MLService` class.
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `self`: Instance of the class.
    -   `analytics_service`: An external service passed during initialization, likely used by the `ModelTracker` for logging or retrieving analytics data.
-   **Logic**:
    -   Initializes `training_data` as an empty dictionary.
    -   Sets the `MIN_TRAINING_POINTS` constant.
    -   Creates an instance of `ModelTracker`, passing the `analytics_service` to it.
    -   Sets the `current_model_version` string.

##### `async predict_workload(self, horizon: int) -> List[Dict]`

-   **Purpose**: An asynchronous method designed to predict future workload based on historical data or current state. The exact prediction logic is not implemented in the provided snippet (indicated by `pass`).
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `self`: Instance of the class.
    -   `horizon: int`: An integer specifying the time period (e.g., number of days, hours) into the future for which the workload should be predicted.
-   **Returns**: `List[Dict]`: Expected to return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary likely represents a predicted workload value for a specific point in the future horizon.
-   **Logic**:
    -   Currently contains only `pass` (Line 16), indicating the implementation details are missing or located elsewhere. It should contain the core logic for loading the relevant model, preparing input data, performing the prediction, and formatting the output.
