# Module: payment

This module handles payment processing functionalities, specifically integrating with the PayPal REST API.

## Directory Structure

```

```

## File: `paypalService.d.ts`

### Purpose

This TypeScript declaration file provides type definitions for the `paypalService.js` module, enabling type checking and improved developer experience when using the service within a TypeScript project. It defines the expected data structures and function signatures.

### Interfaces

-   **`PaymentData`** (Lines 2-6)
    -   Defines the structure for data required to create a payment.
    -   `amount: number`: The amount of the payment.
    -   `currency: string`: The currency code (e.g., "USD").
    -   *(Comment indicates other relevant properties might be added)*.
-   **`PaymentResponse`** (Lines 8-12)
    -   Defines the structure of the response expected after a payment creation attempt.
    -   `success: boolean`: Indicates whether the payment creation was successful.
    -   `transactionId?: string`: An optional field containing the PayPal transaction ID if successful.
    -   `errorMessage?: string`: An optional field containing an error message if the operation failed.

### Exported Functions

-   **`createPayment(data: PaymentData): Promise<PaymentResponse>`** (Line 14)
    -   Declares an asynchronous function `createPayment`.
    -   Takes one argument `data` of type `PaymentData`.
    -   Returns a `Promise` that resolves with a `PaymentResponse`.
    -   **Note**: This signature uses Promises, which differs from the callback-based implementation in `paypalService.js`.

## File: `paypalService.js`

### Purpose

This file contains the actual JavaScript implementation for interacting with the PayPal REST API using the `paypal-rest-sdk`. It handles the configuration of the SDK and provides a function to create payments.

### Imports

-   **`const paypal = require('paypal-rest-sdk');`** (Line 1): Imports the official PayPal REST SDK for Node.js.
-   **`const config = require('../../config/paypal');`** (Line 2): Imports PayPal configuration settings (like API keys and mode) from a configuration file located two levels up in the directory structure (`src/config/paypal.js` - assuming based on path).

### SDK Configuration (Lines 4-8)

-   Calls `paypal.configure()` to set up the SDK.
-   Uses values imported from the `config` object:
    -   `mode`: Sets the PayPal environment (e.g., 'sandbox' or 'live').
    -   `client_id`: Sets the PayPal API client ID.
    -   `client_secret`: Sets the PayPal API client secret.

### Functions

-   **`createPayment(paymentData, callback)`** (Lines 10-17)
    -   **Purpose**: Initiates a payment creation request with PayPal.
    -   **Parameters**:
        -   `paymentData`: An object containing the details required by the PayPal API to create a payment (structure should align with PayPal SDK requirements, likely similar to the `PaymentData` interface in the `.d.ts` file).
        -   `callback`: A standard Node.js callback function `function(error, payment)` that will be called upon completion.
    -   **Logic**:
        -   Calls the `paypal.payment.create` method from the SDK, passing the `paymentData` and the `callback`.
        -   The SDK handles the API request to PayPal.
        -   If an `error` occurs during the API call, the callback is invoked with the `error` as the first argument (Line 13).
        -   If the API call is successful, the callback is invoked with `null` for the error and the `payment` object received from PayPal as the second argument (Line 15).
    -   **Note**: This implementation uses a callback pattern, which differs from the Promise-based signature defined in `paypalService.d.ts`. Consumers of this module in a modern async/await context might need to wrap this function (e.g., using Node.js's `util.promisify`).

### Exports

-   **`module.exports = { createPayment };`** (Line 19): Exports the `createPayment` function, making it available for other modules to import and use.
