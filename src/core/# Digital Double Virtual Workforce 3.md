# Digital Double Virtual Workforce 3.5 - Edge-Ready, Secure, and Compliant AI Platform

---

## Overview

This document details the **edge deployment**, **security**, and **compliance** features of Digital Double Virtual Workforce 3.5, complementing the unified platform vision described in the [README](../../README.md).

---

## Core Philosophy

- **Offline-First:** Operate fully without internet connectivity.
- **Edge-Optimized:** Run on resource-constrained devices.
- **Security-First:** Protect data and operations with advanced security.
- **Compliance-Ready:** Support GDPR, audit trails, and legal hold.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Maintain functionality under adverse conditions.
