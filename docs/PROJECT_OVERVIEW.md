# Project Overview - Digital Double Virtual Workforce 3.5

---

## Vision

A fully autonomous, adaptive, multi-agent AI platform with immersive visualization, real-time research, internal IDE, plugin integration, self-healing, and edge-ready deployment.

---

## Architecture Summary

- **Local AI Model:** Llama.cpp-based, accessed via Python API.
- **Frontend Visualization:** Pixel-art avatars, immersive chat-driven UI, real-time updates.
- **Multi-Agent System:** Specialized agents (planner, researcher, coder, messenger, execution, creative, file) collaborating autonomously.
- **Integration Layer:** JavaScript bridges model outputs to UI.
- **Plugin Adapters:** Docker, Git, CI/CD, APIs, System Control, extendable via event-driven design.
- **Self-Healing & Predictive Analytics:** Monitors, predicts, and corrects faults autonomously.
- **Edge-Ready & Secure:** Offline-first, compliance-focused, with adaptive failover.

## Core Capabilities

### Autonomous Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Agents autonomously generate, prioritize, and schedule tasks.
- Role-based collaboration enables complex workflows.
- Multi-step reasoning with chained prompts.
- Dynamic task decomposition and coordination.

### Immersive Pixel-Art UI
- Pixel avatars visualize agent states and collaboration.
- Real-time updates via WebSockets.
- Chat-driven interface for commands and feedback.
- Planned drag-and-drop workflow editor.

### Real-Time Research & Adaptive Learning
- Web scraping via headless browsers, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.
- Internal knowledge base updated continuously.
- Adaptive prompt refinement and self-reprogramming.
- Scientific reasoning and synthesis path prediction.

### Internal IDE & Code Automation
- Autonomous code writing, execution, and validation.
- Contextual code generation and debugging.
- Real-time feedback loop for self-improvement.
- Codebase analysis, fix suggestions, and automated debugging.

### Plugin Integration & API Chaining
- Event-driven plugin adapters for Docker, Git, CI/CD, APIs.
- Sequential and parallel API calls for complex pipelines.
- Secure, auditable, and extendable integration layer.

### Memory, Context, and Personalization
- Dynamic memory for task continuity.
- Conversation history and metadata management.
- Personalized recommendations based on user data.
- Cross-platform calendar integration.

### Self-Healing & Predictive Fault Analytics
- **SelfHealingManager:** Detects anomalies, triggers corrective routines, iteratively refines repairs.
- **MLService:** Predicts faults before they occur, enabling preemptive adjustments.
- Closed-loop resilience for continuous autonomous improvement.

### Edge-Ready, Secure, and Compliant
- Offline operation with local inference.
- Adaptive quantization and resource governance.
- Zero-knowledge proofs, trusted execution environments.
- GDPR compliance, audit trails, legal hold capabilities.

## How It Works

1. **User issues commands** via chat or UI.
2. **Multi-agent system** plans, decomposes, and executes tasks.
3. **Pixel avatars** visualize agent activities and collaboration.
4. **Agents research, generate code, and integrate data.**
5. **Plugin adapters** automate external tools and APIs.
6. **Self-healing modules** monitor and correct errors.
7. **Knowledge base** updates dynamically.
8. **Automated workflows** execute with minimal human input.

- Drag-and-drop visual workflow editor.
- Advanced personalization and user profiling.
- Cross-device synchronization.
- Scientific reasoning modules.
- Federated learning and edge-to-cloud sync.

---

## Testing & Validation

- Unit tests for agents, plugins, self-healing, ML.
- Integration tests for full system workflows.
- Continuous validation of autonomous behaviors.
- Automated documentation sync and update.
