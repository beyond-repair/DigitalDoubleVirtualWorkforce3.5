---

## Documentation & Architecture

- [ ] Sync all docs with unified README vision (DONE)
- [ ] Expand API Reference (`docs/api.md`)
- [ ] Add SDK usage examples for ModelTracker, MLService, plugin adapters
- [ ] Generate detailed system architecture diagrams (DONE)
- [ ] Document agent prompt templates and role definitions
- [ ] Define Redis channel naming conventions
- [ ] Document security model: RBAC, audit logs, encryption plans
- [ ] Cross-link all documentation files
