## Architecture

- **Local AI Model:** Llama.cpp-based model accessed via Python API.
- **Frontend Visualization:** Pixel-art avatars with real-time updates and user command input.
- **Multi-Agent System:** Specialized agents (planner, researcher, coder, etc.) collaborating autonomously.
- **Integration Layer:** JavaScript bridges model outputs to UI.
- **Extensible APIs:** Connects to external services, plugins, and data sources.
- **Self-Healing & Predictive Analytics:** Monitors, predicts, and corrects faults autonomously.

## Core Features

### 1. Pixelated Visual Representation
- Dynamic pixel avatar reflects agent states (idle, working, researching).
- Built with React/Vue.js + PixiJS or Three.js.
- Real-time visualization of agent activities.

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Multiple specialized agents coordinate to solve complex problems.
- Role-based orchestration with autonomous task generation and scheduling.

### 3. Real-Time Web Scraping & Research
- Gathers live data via headless browsers or APIs.
- Uses BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or internal knowledge base.
- Continuously updates knowledge for adaptive learning.

### 4. Internal IDE for Code Generation & Testing
- Autonomous code writing, execution, and validation.
- Supports contextual code generation and debugging.
- Real-time feedback loop for self-improvement.

### 5. Autonomous Task Creation & Scheduling
- Generates, prioritizes, and schedules tasks without manual input.
- Supports multi-step reasoning and complex workflows.

### 6. Dynamic Memory & Context Management
- Maintains metadata, conversation history, and task context.
- Enables continuity and context-aware decision-making.

### 7. API Integration & Chaining
- Calls multiple APIs sequentially or in parallel.
- Enables complex data pipelines and workflow automation.

### 8. Document Understanding & Summarization
- Parses and summarizes PDFs, docs, datasets, and web pages.
- Supports scientific reasoning and synthesis path prediction.

### 9. Personalized Recommendations
- Analyzes user data for health, productivity, and learning suggestions.

### 10. Plug-and-Play App Connectivity
- Planned support for Zapier and similar platforms.
- Seamless integration with external apps and services.

### 11. Event-Driven Automation
- Trigger-action workflows based on events or data changes.

### 12. Codebase Analysis & Debugging
- Analyzes code, suggests fixes, and automates debugging.

### 13. Self-Reprogramming Capabilities
- Modifies its own prompts, workflows, or code to adapt and scale.

### 14. Dependency & Package Management
- Handles installation, updates, and conflict resolution autonomously.

### 15. Computer System & Hardware Control
- Automates system processes, file management, and hardware interaction.
- Supports IoT device integration and real-time control.

### 16. Self-Healing & Predictive Fault Analytics
- **SelfHealingManager:** Detects anomalies, triggers corrective routines, and iteratively refines repairs.
- **MLService:** Predicts faults before they occur, enabling preemptive adjustments.
- Closed-loop resilience for continuous autonomous improvement.

### 17. Visual Workflow Automation
- UI allows users to create, monitor, and adjust workflows visually.

### 18. Cross-Platform Calendar Integration
- Connects with Google, Outlook, and other calendar APIs for scheduling.
